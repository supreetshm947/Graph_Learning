This file contains the train and validation splits of HIV, Amazon and IMDB.

HIV [4] is a binary graph classification dataset. It has node and edge attributes given as real-valued vectors.

MUTAG [1] is a binary graph classification dataset. It has discrete node labels as input features.

Amazon [2] is an 8-class node classification dataset. Your task is to predict the node label based on the node attributes and the graph structure.

IMDB [3] is a binary graph classification dataset. It has no node labels or node attributes (all nodes have dummy label 1).
